				<h2>My Autobiographical Essay</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The moment of my birth at Moi Avenue Hospital in Nairobi remains etched in the fabric of my earliest memories, just like I was narrated to by my parents I will do it here. It was a tranquil evening, with the golden hues of the setting sun casting a warm glow over the bustling city, for simplicity “kondoo wakiingishwa kwa nyumba yao”. As the clock struck 6:00 PM, I entered the world, greeted by the screams of other women in labor at the hospital and the loving embrace of my mother.</p>
			<p>Growing up in a single-parent household, my family unit was defined by resilience, love, and unwavering support. While my father had remarried and embarked on a separate journey, my mother stood as the cornerstone of our family, providing us with the love, guidance, and stability we needed to thrive. Her strength and determination in the face of adversity served as a constant source of inspiration, instilling within me a deep sense of gratitude and admiration.</p>
			<p>As the second eldest among my siblings, I assumed a role of leadership and responsibility from a young age. With four siblings and four step-siblings, our household was a bustling hub of activity, each member contributing their own unique perspective and energy to the familial dynamic. Despite the complexities inherent in navigating a blended family, we forged deep bonds of camaraderie and mutual respect, grounded in a shared history and a common sense of purpose.</p>
			<p>Throughout my childhood, I cherished the moments spent with each family member, from lively dinners filled with laughter and storytelling to quiet evenings spent curled up with a book or watching movies together. These shared experiences served to strengthen our bonds and foster a sense of belonging that transcended biological ties.
				One particular aspect of our family dynamic that stands out in my memory is the way we supported and uplifted each other during times of need. Whether it was offering a listening ear, providing words of encouragement, or lending a helping hand, we stood united in facing life's challenges head-on. This sense of solidarity and empathy has been instrumental in shaping my values and worldview, teaching me the importance of compassion, resilience, and unconditional love.
				</p>
				<p>Looking back on my upbringing, I am grateful for the richness and diversity of experiences that my family provided. Each family member, whether sibling, step-sibling, or parent, has played a unique and invaluable role in shaping who I am today. Their influence, guidance, and unwavering support have been the bedrock upon which I have built my life, and for that, I am eternally grateful.</p>

			<div id="section1-content" style="display: none;">
				<p>Despite the complexities inherent in navigating the dynamics of a blended family, I cherished the bonds forged with my step-siblings, each relationship enriching my life in unexpected ways. Together, we weathered the storms of adolescence, celebrated milestones, and formed an unbreakable bond grounded in love, mutual respect, and shared experiences.</p>
				<p>As I reflect on my journey from childhood to adolescence, I am reminded of the indelible impact of family on shaping my identity and worldview. From the tender moments of childhood innocence to the formative years of adolescence, I carry with me the values instilled by my family – integrity, compassion, and perseverance.</p>
				<p>My upbringing in a single-parent family, surrounded by siblings and step-siblings, has been a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of love. It is a journey defined by strength in adversity, unity in diversity, and the unwavering belief that, together, we can overcome any obstacle life presents.</p>
				<p>The early chapters of my childhood narrative unfolded against the backdrop of transitions and geographical changes. Following my birth, my family embarked on a journey that led us to the tranquil shores of Kisumu, a city nestled along the banks of Lake Victoria. It was here, in the embrace of nature's serenity, that I took my first steps and uttered my first words.</p>
				<p>Settling into our new surroundings, we embraced the rhythm of rural life with open arms. The sprawling landscapes, adorned with lush greenery and golden fields, offered a stark contrast to the bustling streets of Nairobi. Amidst the idyllic charm of the countryside, I discovered a profound sense of belonging, rooted in the rich tapestry of community life. I remember I did not know how to make friends but my sister was always taking me to hang out with her friends, talk about world greatest big sister. We used to go for boat rides and watched fishermen fish and at the end of the day buy fish. The greatest memory was visiting snake park. To date I no longer fear snakes. I reminisce with my childhood pictures day after day since I have framed and hanged them on my walls.</p>
				<p>My educational journey commenced amidst the serene beauty of Kisumu's idyllic landscapes, where I eagerly embarked on my academic endeavors. Beginning from the tender age of baby class and nursery, I delved into the realm of learning, immersing myself in the wonders of drawing, coloring, and engaging with fellow pupils. While the majority of my time was spent in joyful activities like nap time and games, each day brought new discoveries and opportunities for growth.</p>
				<p>Transitioning to the countryside, I continued my educational odyssey, progressing through pre-unit and into the early years of primary school. Here, amidst the rustic charm of rural life, I expanded my knowledge and honed my skills, guided by dedicated teachers and surrounded by the natural beauty of the countryside. Every lesson, every interaction, was a stepping stone on my journey of academic exploration, shaping my understanding of the world and fostering a love for learning that would endure for years to come. Every morning at the local stage of ‘Bronjo’ center a school van which was also used as the local matatu during the day would pick me and my older sister and because I was the youngest I had the privilege to sit next to the driver. For me it was the scariest time of my day because the driver would tell me to hold the brakes with my tiny short legs and would tell me if I let go we would all die. I know you are all thinking what kind of person he was but, one time when I was visiting my grandparents he recognized me and told me that he was just training me to not be afraid. </p>
				<p>To this day I know that he brake pedal is at the center among the three pedals. Anyway that one year at the country side moved really fast but I made friends with my teachers. Whenever I get an opportunity to visit my grandparents I would also go see them. I remember my mother telling me a story of how they came to realize I am anti-social. She said she was called to school by one of my teachers claiming I do not talk to other kids in the class, she said I sit alone, don’t raise my hand when she asks questions but I excel. My mum told her to lock me and my sister in one room and she will see the results. She was so shocked.</p>
				<p>As I reflect on those formative years spent in Kisumu, I am reminded of the profound impact of my rural upbringing on shaping my values and worldview. It was a time marked by simplicity, resilience, and the enduring spirit of community. In the embrace of nature's embrace, I discovered the transformative power of education and the boundless possibilities that awaited on the horizon.</p>
				<p>Though our journey would eventually lead us to new destinations and chapters in life, the memories of my childhood in Kisumu remain etched in the corridors of my mind, a testament to the beauty of beginnings and the resilience of the human spirit.</p>
				<p>The next chapter of my childhood journey unfolded against the backdrop of Nairobi's bustling streets, where the rhythm of urban life pulsed with energy and vitality. We stayed at a place called Umoja estate, lived in flats. It was in this vibrant metropolis that I continued my academic pursuits, navigating the corridors of knowledge with determination and curiosity at Eastend Primary School, from class one to class four. From the towering skyscrapers to the bustling markets, Nairobi offered a kaleidoscope of experiences, each contributing to my growth and development. Every morning we would be woken up at 6am, prepared and walk to school. In the evening with our daily snacks allowance money we would buy ice cream at 10 shillings and the remaining save in our piggy banks.</p>
				<p>As I delved deeper into my studies, I found myself immersed in a melting pot of cultures and ideas, expanding my horizons and broadening my perspective on the world. The city's diverse landscape provided fertile ground for exploration, fueling my thirst for knowledge and discovery.</p>
				<p>Yet, just as quickly as we had arrived, our family found ourselves drawn to the tranquil beauty of Ngong, a serene enclave nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Great Rift Valley. Here, amidst the whispering winds and the gentle rustle of leaves, I discovered a newfound sense of peace and belonging.</p>
				<p>Enrolling in a local school in Ngong called Kenvic Preparatory School, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth at class 4. The two transformative terms spent in this idyllic setting left an indelible mark on my soul, as I immersed myself in the wonders of nature and the simple joys of rural life. From exploring lush forests to picnicking by pristine streams, every moment in Ngong was a testament to the beauty of simplicity and the power of connection with the natural world. It was a sad year since my dad decided to move out and join another family. But my mum would always find a way to cheer us up. Sundays were for church, Saturdays for family picnic.</p>
				<p>The scenic beauty and peaceful atmosphere of Ngong nurtured my love for the outdoors, instilling within me a deep appreciation for the wonders of creation. As I roamed the verdant hills and gazed upon the expansive vistas stretching before me, I felt a profound sense of gratitude and wonder, humbled by the majesty of the world around me. We lived at a hilltop and without a car that was exercise. We were the third habitants at that place and this meant no neighbors, no friends. But soon the place was filled with house constructions then neighbors. Too bad the place was no longer safe.</p>
				<p>One night when my dad was still living with us he was late and we all fell asleep waiting for him. My mother was awakened by the groans of a man outside with white t-shirt. First glance and she quickly concluded the man was my father. She was so terrified tried to call to confirm it wasn’t him but he did not answer. When she got the emergency contact and about to call she sees my father’s car pull up. She opened the door with towels to help the bleeding man, only to realize, that was our neighbor. He was beaten and cut severally. She went to call the wife and brought the man’s kids to our place as the mom takes the dad to the hospital together with my father. That was the day we realized it was never safe in Ngong but it was too late to relocate, we had bought the house.</p>
				<p>In retrospect, my time in Nairobi and Ngong served as a tapestry of experiences, each thread weaving its way into the fabric of my identity. From the hustle and bustle of urban life to the tranquility of rural serenity, I embraced the diversity of my surroundings, finding solace and inspiration in the ever-changing landscape of my journey.
					Embarking on the next phase of my educational journey, I found myself navigating the halls of a boarding school nestled amidst the picturesque landscapes of Nandi County. Stepping onto the grounds of this esteemed institution, I was filled with a mixture of excitement and apprehension, eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.
